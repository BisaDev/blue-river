## Key takeaways


* Many  things will seem overkill, I just wanted to show how scalable this app can be.
* O(n) - I'm aware of the complexity of the sorting operations and the fact that I could've used a library , 
I just needed to know it was possible with JS (the painful way :p)
* Styling - Tried to represent a workflow where I could have individual control of components using SASS. I'm also using 
foundation since it's add classes for common css set ups.
* Separated API calls in functions folder
* Types - I'm using proptypes to ensure good practice when assigning
* This project is handling state using Class components
